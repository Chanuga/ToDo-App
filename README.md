# ToDo-App

## Clone the Project

Once you get the link from the github you need to run `git clone {coppied link}` to clone the project. 

Then you need to install via `npm install`. It will create all the dependencies. 

## Cypress Testing

For unit testing here I used Cypress

Once you cloned the project Just run `npm install cypress` to install the cypress dependencies.

Then run `npx cypress open`. it will give the dashboard of cypress and with the list of tests. Then you need to just click on a test case. It will run through the end if there are no errors. 

** For this test scenario I added `http://localhost:3000/` as the default url. You can change it as you wish. 

Thanks.
